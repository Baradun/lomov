# The repository purpose

This repository contains code to compare different methods for solving
Schoringer-like equation using Magnus expansion. These methods uses fixed step
and Putzer algorithm to compute matrix exponent (for 3Ã—3 matrix).

# How to run the code

The code of main program is written in C++ (actually using some features of
C++2a), most scripts are written in python, for plotting data we use GNUPLOT.

To compile code and run

    meson setup BUILDDIR
    cd BUILDDIR
    meson compile
    meson compile methods

This requires meson (best with 0.57+), python3, ncurses (for methods.py) and
pandas (for stat.py).
